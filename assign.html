      <h2>1. Choose Common Components Wisely</h2>
      <p>Data engineering often involves integrating multiple systems. Using widely adopted, standardized components reduces complexity, promotes compatibility, and ensures better support. Evaluate maturity, community support, and extensibility before choosing tools or frameworks.</p>
      <p>Choosing the right tools from the beginning helps teams avoid technical debt and vendor lock-in. Standard components typically come with robust documentation and established best practices, which facilitate easier onboarding and smoother collaboration between teams. Furthermore, commonly used components are more likely to have integrations with other platforms and are regularly updated to address security and performance issues.</p>

      <h2>2. Plan for Failure</h2>
      <p>Failures are inevitable in distributed systems. Design with fault tolerance in mind—use retries, redundancy, and graceful degradation. Monitor systems proactively to detect issues early and recover quickly.</p>
      <p>Effective failure planning includes implementing alerting mechanisms, automated failovers, and well-documented incident response protocols. Embracing a "chaos engineering" approach—where failures are deliberately introduced to test resilience—can reveal hidden vulnerabilities and improve overall system robustness. Always assume that individual services, network connections, or even data centers might fail at some point.</p>

      <h2>3. Architect for Scalability</h2>
      <p>As data grows, your systems must handle increased load. Choose scalable storage and processing technologies. Use asynchronous processing, caching, and sharding where necessary to maintain performance under scale.</p>
      <p>Scalability should be both vertical (stronger hardware) and horizontal (more nodes). Cloud-native solutions and microservices architectures offer flexibility to scale individual components independently. Load testing, capacity planning, and real-time performance monitoring help ensure that growth in data volume or user demand doesn't degrade the system’s responsiveness or reliability.</p>
